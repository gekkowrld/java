# Java Project Repository

Welcome to the Java Project Repository! This repository serves as a collection of my Java projects and random codes as I learn and explore the language. Feel free to browse through the files and contribute if you'd like. Your contributions, feedback, and suggestions are greatly appreciated!

7. Push your changes to your forked repository: `git push origin your-branch-name`.
8. Open a pull request in this repository, providing a detailed description of your changes.

Please make sure to adhere to the existing code style, conventions, and documentation guidelines.

## Running

If you want to run/compile the program then you must have both java and javac installed.  
If not, you can install them at <https://www.oracle.com/downloads/#category-java>

Then run if you are on a GNU/Linux Operating system:

```bash
java file_name.java # To compile java files
javac file_name # To run the compiled file, it shouldn't have an extension
```

That should compile and run most of the files in the `basics` folder.

You can also just use the `run.sh` file by running `./run.sh` and it will compile the latest edited files in the folder.

## Issues

If you encounter any issues with the projects or have ideas for improvements, please feel free to open an issue in the repository. Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the problem or suggestion, along with any relevant information.
